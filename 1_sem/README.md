# Core-2 Practical: Programming Fundamentals using C Lab 
1. Write a Program to find greatest among three numbers.
2. Write a Program to all arithmetic operation using switch case. 
3. Write a Program to print the sum and product of digits of an integer.
4. Write a Program to reverse a number.
5. Write a Program to compute the sum of the first n terms of the following series 

> S = 1+1/2+1/3+1/4+……

6. Write a Program to compute the sum of the first n terms of the following series 

> S =1-2+3-4+5……………

7. Write a function that checks whether a given string is Palindrome or not. Use this function to find whether the string entered by user is Palindrome or not.
8. Write a function to find whether a given no. is prime or not. Use the same to generate the       prime numbers less than 100.
9. Write a Program to compute the factors of a given number.
10. Write a program to swap two numbers using macro.
11. Write a Program to print a triangle of stars as follows (take number of lines from user): 
```
*
***
*****
*******
```
12. Write a Program to perform following actions on an array entered by the user:
    - a)Print the even-valued elements
    - b)Print the odd-valued elements
    - c)Calculate and print the sum and average of the elements of array
    - d)Print the maximum and minimum element of array
    - e)Remove the duplicates from the array
    - f)Print the array in reverse order

The program should present a menu to the user and ask for one of the options. The menu should also include options to re-enter array and to quit the program.

13. Write a Program that prints a table indicating the number of occurrences of each alphabet in the text entered as command line arguments.
14. Write a program that swaps two numbers using pointers. 
15. Write a program in which a function is passed address of two variables and then alter its contents. 
16. Write a program which takes the radius of a circle as input from the user, passes it to another function that computes the area and the circumference of the circle and displays the value of area and circumference from the main( ) function. 
17. Write a program to find sum and average of n elements entered by the user. To write this program, allocate memory dynamically using malloc( ) / calloc( ) functions. 
18. Write a menu driven program to perform following operations on strings:
    - a) Show address of each character in string
    - b) Concatenate two strings without using strcat function. 
    - c) Concatenate two strings using strcat function. 
    - d) Compare two strings 
    - e) Calculate length of the string (use pointers) 
    - f) Convert all lowercase characters to uppercase 
    - g) Convert all uppercase characters to lowercase 
    - h) Calculate number of vowels
    - i) Reverse the string 

19. Given two ordered arrays of integers, write a program to merge the two-arrays to get an ordered array.
20. Write a program to copy the content of one file to other.
