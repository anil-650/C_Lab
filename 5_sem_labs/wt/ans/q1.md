## 1. Acquaintance with elements, tags and basic structure of HTML


HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the basic
structural element that is used to create webpages. HTML is a
markup language, which means that it is used to "mark up" the
content within a document, in this case a webpage, with
structural and semantic information that tells a browser how to
display a page. When an HTML document is loaded by a web browser,
the browser uses the HTML tags that have marked up the document
to render the page's content.
There are three types of code that make up a basic website page. HTML
governs the structural elements, CSS styles those elements, and
JavaScript enables dynamic interaction between those elements.

## Elements and Tags

HTML elements and tags work together to mark up content. HTML elements
indicate the purpose of a tag and tags indicate the beginning and the
end of an element.

For example, here is a simple paragraph in HTML:

    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

The letter "`p`" represents the paragraph element. In this example,
`<p>` is an opening tag that tells the browser that the content that
follows it is a paragraph. The slash in the second tag, `</p>`,
indicates that it is a closing tag that tells the browser that the
paragraph element is ending and that any content that appears after it
is not part of the paragraph.

## Basic HTML Page Structure

A basic HTML page is a document that typically has the file extension
`.html`, though HTML frequently appears in the content of other file
types as well. All HTML documents follow the same basic structure so
that the browser that renders the file knows what to do. The basic
structure on which all webpages are built looks like this:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Homepage Headline</h1>
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        </body>
    </html>

When this code is rendered by a browser, it will look like this:

### Doctype

The first line of code, `<!DOCTYPE html>`, is called a doctype
declaration and tells the browser which version of HTML the page is
written in. In this case, we're using the doctype that corresponds to
HTML5, the most up-to-date version of the HTML language. There are a
number of 

### HTML Root Element

Next, the `<html>` element wraps around all of the other code and
content in our document. This element, known as the HTML root
element

### Head Element

The HTML head element is a container that can include a number of HTML elements that are not
visible parts of the page rendered by the browser. These elements are
either metadata that describe information about the page or are helping
pull in external resources like CSS stylesheets or JavaScript files.

The `<title>` element is the only element that is required to be
contained within the `<head>` tags. The content within this element is
displayed as the page title in the tab of the browser and is also what
search engines use to identify the title of a page.

All of the HTML elements that can be used inside the `<head>` element
are:

- `<base>`
- `<link>`
- `<meta>`
- `<noscript>`
- `<script>`
- `<style>`
- `<title>`

### Body Element

There can only be one <body> element in an HTML document because this element is the container that holds the
content of the document. All of the content that you see rendered in the
browser is contained within this element. In the example above, the
content of the page is a headline and simple paragraph.

## Nesting

You might have noticed that I keep referring to HTML elements as
"containers." This is because proper "nesting" is a key part of writing
HTML that will work across all browsers, will render all content, will
be readable by screen readers, and will be able to be targeted by CSS
and JavaScript. In terms of HTML, nesting means exactly what you'd think
it might mean: each element goes inside another element, just like nesting dolls
are physically "nested" within each other.


## Conclusion

In this post we've learned what HTML is, what an HTML element is, what
an HTML tag is, and how a basic HTML page is structured.
